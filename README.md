# Server for Password Manager Application
This server acts as the backend for a [secure password management application](https://github.com/jinxAlex/user-client), handling user authentication and encrypted passwords storage. It operates under a zero-knowledge architecture, meaning that all passwords are encrypted on the client side before reaching the server.
